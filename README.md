# Pizza Order Form

This application will display a list of options for building a pizza. Once the order is finished it is to be saved (created). Additional
functionality will allow the user to display all orders (read), a specific order (read), modify the order (update) and cancel the order
(delete). Let the user know when each operation is complete. The text on controls such as buttons must be able to toggle between
English and Dutch and maintain the last toggled state between start-ups.

A requirement of the assignment was using string arrays and java arrays to update the language based on shared preferences.
